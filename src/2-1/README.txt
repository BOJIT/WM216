This interface allows the user to explore the dynamical system of a car and trailer moving down a straight horizontal road. The system is represented by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. A Simulink model is used to solve these equations for displacement, velocity and acceleration of the system. 
Physical parameters and environmental constants can be edited from the interface.  
When the system changes velocity an oscillation is established between the car and trailer as they trade kinetic energies. The effects of one bodys changing velocity on the other is only felt after a short time. This is because the spring introduces a delay causing the oscillation seen in the acceleration-time and velocity-time graphs. 
By manipulating the spring constant k, the magnitude of this oscillation can be changed.
The idea of introducing a dampener in parallel with the spring is also explored, the dampener acts against the spring reducing oscillations.
The point at which the car and trailor come to rest is treated as the point at which one of them shows negative velocity due to the oscilation and is at about 475 seconds.
